	<h2 class="titletop"> Trevor's Background </h2>
	<p>
	I have lived in the same house in Dubuque, Iowa for my entire life. Dubuque has grown to be a very nice city over the 
	years with additions like The Port of Dubuque located along the Mississippi River, the Dubuque Fighting Saints hockey program and newly constructed Mystique Ice Center, 
	and the never ending expansion onto the west end of town. I grew up on the ice playing travel hockey with my best friends and it has always been my favorite sport along with
	the occasional game of street football. I have one brother, Kyle who is twenty six, my mother, Coleen, and my dad, Brett. They are all very nice people. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I attended Dubuque Senior High School where I excelled on the track and field and hockey teams. I worked my first job at a local grocery store by my house followed
	by a Nordstrom's delivery center where I unloaded inventory from semis each day. Not the most fun jobs, but the pay check was always nice even though I spent the
	majority of my earnings on shoes which no longer fit me. After high school I began my career here at The University of Iowa as an overwhelmed and unorganized freshman. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I am currently a junior in the Tippie College of Business studying BAIS. This past summer I interned at IBM in Dubuque, Iowa in the audit and compliance department. 
	I received a lot of great experience as well as dipped my toes into the real world of business. This coming summer of 2014 I will be interning in Des Moines, Iowa 
	at Berkley Technology Services as a financial systems analyst. In my free time I enjoy snowboarding, traveling, playing hockey, and engaging in those other 
	activities college students are so fond of. After graduation I plan on taking my talents to Colorado and living happily ever after.
